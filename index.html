            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                <i>Potion Problems</i> is a 2D online multiplayer party game. It is a Thesis/Advanced Game Project
                directed by 3rd year MFA student, Alison Seidner. I listed this first because my experience on this
                project has
                inspired and motivated me to lead a thesis project of my own. My role is as a volunteer
                <u>Usability Researcher</u>.
                My responsibilities include conducting playtests, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the team to
                improve
                the game's user experience.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                <i>Best Friends Forever</i> is a 2D platformer and AI interactive experience. You play as Cassie, a tech-savvy and music
                    loving 16 year-old girl, who is dealing with the loss of her best friend, Jamie. In order to cope with Jamie’s
                    passing, Cassie trains an AI chatbot to talk just like Jamie. This game uses the OpenAI API so that the player can
                    chat directly with ChatGPT in the game. This game was made for a joint-final project for CTIN 534 and 541 at USC. I
                    was the Lead Programmer, and my responsibilities included coding, level design, UI design, and implementation of
                    art assets.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This project was made for CTIN 534 with Peter Brinson at USC. The goal of The Dreamer assignment is to
                make a “Bad Dream
                Escape Room”. This game aims to blend elements of reality and fiction, placing the player in the role of
                a veteran
                battling PTSD. They encounter bizarre phenomena, like exploding Teddy Bears, highlighting the fragmented
                boundaries
                between their inner turmoil and the outside world. This game is currently a work in progress, and is
                being made with
                Unity.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This game was my midterm project for CTIN 583 with Debbie Yuen at USC. The assignment was to make a game
                that tackles a
                social justice issue. I chose to make a game that educates players about the effects of littering and
                plastic pollution.
                This is a tower defense game where you place Turtle Tanks to destroy plastic waste before it can reach
                the ocean. Waves
                of trash spawn each round, and the amount of trash increases with each round. Made in Unity.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This project was made for the Meaningful Play assignment in CTIN 541 with Tracy Fullerton. My group and
                I aimed to
                create an immersive experience full of tension and drama. We developed a “whodunit” murder mystery game
                where players
                assume the roles of five characters, each with ties to the murder. As they unravel clues, players must
                either work
                together to uncover the true killer or devise strategies to avoid suspicion and escape detection.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This is a project I worked on during undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, for a Halloween-themed game jam. It is
                a visual novel
                that adapts the story of La Lechuza, which is rooted in Mexican and Texano folklore. According to
                legend, La Lechuza
                was a witch who made a deal with the devil and could transform into a giant owl. I was in charge of
                coding and character
                art for this project. The game was made using Ren'Py.
