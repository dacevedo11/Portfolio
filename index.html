            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                <i>Best Friends Forever</i> is a game currently in development for the "Narrative Play" assignment in CTIN 541 with Tracy
                Fullerton, and will eventually lead into the joint final project for both this class and CTIN 534 with Peter Brinson. The story
                follows Cassie, a teenage girl navigating grief and depression after the loss of her best friend. The game is being
                designed as a 2.5D platformer, combining 2D sprites in a 3D environment to create a visually compelling and emotionally
                immersive experience. As Lead Programmer, I am responsible for implementing core mechanics and ensuring fluid gameplay
                that brings the story's emotional depth to life. The game is being developed in Unity.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This project was made for CTIN 534 with Peter Brinson at USC. The goal of The Dreamer assignment is to
                make a “Bad Dream
                Escape Room”. This game aims to blend elements of reality and fiction, placing the player in the role of
                a veteran
                battling PTSD. They encounter bizarre phenomena, like exploding Teddy Bears, highlighting the fragmented
                boundaries
                between their inner turmoil and the outside world. This game is currently a work in progress, and is
                being made with
                Unity.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This game was my midterm project for CTIN 583 with Debbie Yuen at USC. The assignment was to make a game
                that tackles a
                social justice issue. I chose to make a game that educates players about the effects of littering and
                plastic pollution.
                This is a tower defense game where you place Turtle Tanks to destroy plastic waste before it can reach
                the ocean. Waves
                of trash spawn each round, and the amount of trash increases with each round. Made in Unity.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This project was made for the Meaningful Play assignment in CTIN 541 with Tracy Fullerton. My group and I aimed to
                create an immersive experience full of tension and drama. We developed a “whodunit” murder mystery game where players
                assume the roles of five characters, each with ties to the murder. As they unravel clues, players must either work
                together to uncover the true killer or devise strategies to avoid suspicion and escape detection.

            <p><b>Description:</b><br>
                This is a Visual Novel that I worked on over a 2 week period for a class project. It adapts the story of La Lechuza,
                which is rooted in Mexican and Texano folklore. According to legend, La Lechuza was a witch who made a deal with the
                devil and could transform into a giant owl. I designed the characters and lead the coding part of the project.
